Drag and drop game built using rubaxa/sortablejs

Drag items from two columns on the left and place then in the box on the right.
Rearrange items on the right by dragging and dropping each element. Each time item is added, item on the left is disabled to make sure all items are unique.
Game is limited to 10 items.
Removing item on the right updates UI and enables item on the left to be dragged and dropped.
Each time item is placed, item position is recalculated and updated.

This is only front end functionality.
